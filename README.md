# AirportBookingSystem
This program is desing so the user can login or sign up whith its own credentials. The system is based on C++ and it's main purpose is to allow the user to book a flight and receive a confirmation via SMS.
### Features
This program allows the user to interact with an airline booking system. It can create and cancel reservations, each user needs to be registered, if they do not have an account, the program allows to create one. I try to connect the program with notification via cell text, but this feature is not fully develop.
