# AirportBookingSystem
For my final project in Object Oriented Programming class, I develop a program with classes. Each class has its own attributes and work together in the main.

### Features
The system is based on C++ and it's main purpose is to allow the user to book a flight. Is desing so the user can login or sign up whith its own credentials. I try to connect the program with notification via SMS, but this feature is not fully develop.
